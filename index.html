                                Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank,
                                and
                                dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is
                                called
                                the alpha male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often
                                view their
                                owner as the alpha male.
